Gameplay:
- lots of things, this comes later

Assets:
- Secondary
- Utility
- Death animation
- Log sprites and flavour text

- Special 1: Fish Throw
    - likely base it on drifter utility 1
    - make it possible to randomise fish and their values
- Special 2: Bait Bucket (currently special 1)
    - fix frame issues

Bugs:
- Primary Hitbox should be created at frame 4 -- Will set that up once toolkit rewrite is up and running

Done:
- Loud Explosion sfx on primary needs to get removed -- Won't happen with next tolkit version
- Skill frames get cut short by 1 -- Should not happen with new toolkit version
- Ability to set alt skills needed -- Done
